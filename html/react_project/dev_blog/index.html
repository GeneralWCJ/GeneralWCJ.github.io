                      When I had made this project the first step that I started off with was the React frontend, hardcoded
                      with a set of data, and what was truly a minimum viable product, with some very important and crucial
                      features missing, most importantly testing. However I was trying my best to rush out a proof of concept
                      to show my mom and maybe even get some money out of this project, so the non-essentials were skipped,
                      after all testing by hand would be good enough at the start. Right? Not right, as adding tests would
                      turn out to be nothing but sheer pain, but that wasn't the only bad decision I had made. So let's move
                      on to the backend.
