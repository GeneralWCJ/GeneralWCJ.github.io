        When I had made this project the first step that I started off with was the React frontend, hardcoded
        with a set of data, and what was truly a minimum viable product, with some very important and crucial
        features missing, most importantly testing. However I was trying my best to rush out a proof of concept
        to show my mom and maybe even get some money out of this project, so the non-essentials were skipped,
        after all testing by hand would be good enough at the start. Right? Not right, as adding tests would
        turn out to be nothing but sheer pain, but that wasn't the only bad decision I had made. So let's move
        on to the backend.

    </p>
    <p>
        The backend was actually pretty painless even though I had little experience writing python code, the
        Django web framework came with pretty much everything I needed, and even handled the connection between
        question groups and questions pretty seamlessly behind the hood. Django also handled the creation of
        the API that would eventually connect back into the front-end easily.

    </p>
    <p>
        However, the actual process of merging the frontend and backend was difficult, trying to figure out
        what needed to go in the root directory of the entire project, and what only could stay in the root
        directory of the front end was interesting. Additionally Tailwind CSS was causing me more problems
        than I wanted to deal with so I scrapped that idea and wrote some bare css instead, meaning some
        responsiveness benefits of tailwind were removed, but I figured that getting some CSS on the web
        page would be better than no, and the backend pages also just used bare CSS so having the question
        group view be bare CSS would make it more difficult for the user to even notice the change in how the
        web-pages were rendered.
