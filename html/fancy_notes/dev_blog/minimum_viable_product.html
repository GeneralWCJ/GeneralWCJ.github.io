                With the addition of the ability to have your changes saved the app is now somewhat viable. 
                This leaves me with two options: option 1 is to work on implementing note deletion and moving 
                notes around, or option 2 is to write tests and clean up tech debt to know that I can trust 
                everything and be able to implement new features with less risk of breaking features.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have decided to go for option 2, as while implementing new features is fun, exciting, and 
                visible, cleaning up code and ensuring that I can understand it and change it would be more 
                important to be able to implement new features easier. People who read my first dev blog 
                about why I rewrote my code in Kotlin and deleted everything prior would probably guess 
                that I would have gone for option 2 because going for option 1 would be repeating the mistakes 
                that forced a rewrite in the first place.

            </p>
            <p>
                Hopefully, this cleanup takes &lt2 weeks so I can get back to implementing features that were 
                in the old version of the app.
