                      With the addition of the ability to have your changes saved the app is now somewhat viable. 
                      This leaves me with two options: option 1 is to work on implementing note deletion and moving 
                      notes around, or option 2 is to write tests and clean up tech debt to know that I can trust 
                      everything and be able to implement new features with less risk of breaking features.

                  <p class="card-text">
                    I have decided to rewrite the app. This decision can not be made lightly as a complete and total 
                    rewrite means throwing away weeks of work. So why did I think that this would be useful over just 
                    dealing with the code and trying to wrangle new features into the codebase?
