                  <p class="card-text">
                    Automated testing is the glorious idea that you can make tests to ensure that nothing is broken 
                    and just press one button to run your test suite to make sure that your changes in the code base 
                    didn't break anything. However, implementing tests is difficult. Sometimes tests are easy to 
                    write. Writing unit testing for the note trimming functionality was quite simple and a good 
                    introduction to testing and test-driven development. This is because it was a simple, singular 
                    function that didn't require any connections to databases, the android context, or anything 
                    else. However, not all tests were this simple to write, especially when writing testable code 
                    wasn't the main idea of the previous codebase.

                      With the addition of the ability to have your changes saved the app is now somewhat viable. 
                      This leaves me with two options: option 1 is to work on implementing note deletion and moving 
                      notes around, or option 2 is to write tests and clean up tech debt to know that I can trust 
                      everything and be able to implement new features with less risk of breaking features.

                  <h5 class="card-title">Why Rewrite?</h5>
                  <p class="card-text">
                    I have decided to rewrite the app. This decision can not be made lightly as a complete and total 
                    rewrite means throwing away weeks of work. So why did I think that this would be useful over just 
                    dealing with the code and trying to wrangle new features into the codebase?
