                Sometimes you finish a minimum viable product, and you then determine that that product was really 
                all you wanted to do. That is what happened to this. I just lost interest after getting a minimum 
                viable product out there. This isn't to say that development won't restart sometime in the future, 
                but it is on a halt for an indeterminate period of time.
