                Automated testing is the glorious idea that you can make tests to ensure that nothing is broken 
                and just press one button to run your test suite to make sure that your changes in the code base 
                didn't break anything. However, implementing tests is difficult. Sometimes tests are easy to 
                write. Writing unit testing for the note trimming functionality was quite simple and a good 
                introduction to testing and test-driven development. This is because it was a simple, singular 
                function that didn't require any connections to databases, the android context, or anything 
                else. However, not all tests were this simple to write, especially when writing testable code 
                wasn't the main idea of the previous codebase.

                Now, the test suite is not anywhere near complete, it needs many more unit tests, and at least some 
                end-to-end tests. But let's get back to the title of this. Testing: is the code or the test wrong? 
                Yes. Testing isn't easy, many times the test failed because I messed up something simple, like the 
                indexes of where items were supposed to be. However it wasn't just the testing code that was broken, 
                many times the actual code was broken, but rewriting the code to pass tests made it easier to 
                understand the code and Trust that it would do what I told it to do.
            </p>
            <p>
                So would I continue to write automated tests? Yes, even though they can be a hassle to write, they can 
                still be extremely useful, as debugging the tests many times is easier than debugging the app as a whole.
