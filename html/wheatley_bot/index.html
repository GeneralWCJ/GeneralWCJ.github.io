                Wheatley bot is a bot designed to be bad at playing chess. Not bad in the sense of making illegal moves,
                but bad bytt playinmg the moves that places itself in the worst position, while assuming its oponent
                will play the moves that place the bot in the best position.
            </p>
            <p>
                The way that Wheatley bot decides that its oponent will place the wheatley in the best possible position
                makies it didfrent form different "bad" chess bots like <a href="https://lichess.org/@/WorstFish">
                    worstfish</a> is because wheatley will assume that his opponent is as idiotic as he is.
            </p>
            <p>
                The name Wheatley bot comes from Portal 2 where wheatley is a character that was revealed to be designed
                to be an idiot. It was also revealed that he was the "product of the greatest minds of a generation
                working together to create the dumbest moron who ever lived". Of course wheatley bot is not accurate to
                that part of Portal 2
